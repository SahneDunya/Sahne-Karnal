# Sahne-Karnal-PC
Sahne Karnal PC is a kernel version designed for desktop computers by Sahne Dünya, a member of Sahne Karnal. Sahne DünyaOS is used in SQUAD and desktop versions of systems using the same kernel. Sahne Karnal series is a kernel series developed to be a completely independent operating system. It is generally famous for its Rust ecosystem! Rust language is preferred over C in Sahne Karnal series due to its ownership and borrowing, automatic memory management, zero-cost abstractions and other rich features! Sahne Karnal is not a Unix-like system in essence, but Unix-related code can be found! Sahne64 is an important component in this kernel, Sahne64 is actually the Rust API that provides communication between the user space and the kernel, the main source code is in the kernel! Sahne Karnal has basically preferred the Monotolic architecture!
